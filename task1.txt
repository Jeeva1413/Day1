DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2

HTTP:-
   HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.
   HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 

HTTP1.1:-
    Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web, top-level application 
    protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 
    In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
    In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
    It works on the textual format.
    There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
    It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
    It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2:-
    HTTP/2 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2) is an updated version of the HTTP protocol,
    which was introduced in 2015.It was designed to address some of the limitations and performance issues of 
    HTTP/1.1 and improve the speed and efficiency of web communication.
    It works on the binary protocol.
    It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages .
    It uses HPACK for data compression.
